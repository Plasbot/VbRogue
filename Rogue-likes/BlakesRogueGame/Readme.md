# BlakesRogueGame
A Rogue clone written in Visual Basic.

This was an attempt to write a simple rogue game to teach my son Blake some programming.

After unsuccessfully trying to write it from scratch, we found a similar project and used some of it's code:

Code is very rough in places, as I was trying to get stuff done fast to maintain his interest.  I also tried to make it humorous for an 11 year old in a few spots.
Alas his attention waned quickly as we ran into several obstacles, and the game was left in only a sort-of working state. 

# Issues 
* The spacebar is supposed to initiate an attack and automatically determine a foe within range, but it seems to not work all the time.
* Too many messages produced and hard to tell what's going on, no way to scroll back through messages.
* Animals are supposed to leave behind a dead carcass after death, but somehow still do actions?
